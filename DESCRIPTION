Title: beachmat bindings for TileDB-backed matrices
Description: 
    Extends beachmat to initialize tatami matrices from TileDB-backed arrays.
    This allows C++ code in downstream packages to directly call the TileDB C/C++ library to access array data,
    without the need for block processing via DelayedArray.
    Developers only need to import this package to automatically extend the capabilities of beachmat::initializeCpp to TileDBArray instances.
